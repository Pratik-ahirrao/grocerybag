# grocery bag
Grocery Bag is a way to store grocery items for marketing. It will contain a
homepage that will be showing all the list of items to buy and bought.
Users will be able to add items and update items, and can even delete it.
Users can register themselves and will have a login/logout system.
Users can create a list of grocery items to buy.
flag like - bought , left and not-available tells the status of the particular item.

I have hosted the application on pythonanywhere.
