# grocery bag
Grocery Bag is a way to store grocery items for marketing. <br />
It will contain a
homepage that will be showing all the list of items to buy and bought.<br />
Users will be able to add items and update items, and can even delete it.<br />
Users can register themselves and will have a login/logout system.<br />
Users can create a list of grocery items to buy.<br />
Flag like - BOUGHT , PENDING and NOT AVAILABLE tells the status of the particular item.<br />

I have hosted the application on pythonanywhere.
